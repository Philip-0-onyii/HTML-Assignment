    <h2>An Essay About Myself, Why I Joined Altschools and My Goals After This Program</h2>
    <p> My name is Philip Gideon Onyedikachi, i am from imo state Nigeria but currently based at lagos state. i am a student of the Altschools Academy under the BARAKA Scholarship Fund, School of Engineering, with the Student ID ALT/SOE/025/1247, for the course Backend Engineering.</p>
    <p> I joined Altschools because it presented the opportunity i have always longed for. Growing up, i have always been passionate about tech. I have always visioned myself in the tech space doing so well, i love solving problems and tech seems to be all about it; but then, tech is so expensive. It requires alot of fundings, one which i could never meet up with as a student. Some time around last year, i came across this ad on facebook talking about a fully funded scholarship to learn a tech skill of your choice. Though i was in doubt, my passion drove me. I took the bait and went for it, registered and not long after, took the qualifying exams. The results came out and i did quite well. Soon after, Emails of admission were sent out, i got one and i was so happy.</p>
    <p>As a student of the School of Engineering in Altschools, during the course of this program, i aim at being persistent and consistent, always showing up and dedicating  my time into becoming a better version of who i was yesterday in this course of study. By the end of this program, my goal is to become a certified website developer, understanding various programming languages and codes and how to effectively use them to yield good result, update my CV, monetise my newly acquired skill to elevate my financial life, support the tech space and bring the awareness of it to younger generations about its priviledges, and above all, grow myself better in other related areas to do better and if possible, best. Thankyou Altschool for this opportunity once again, i am so grateful.</p>
